Idea was to make a mobile-friendly site for a football team originating from Joensuu. There were certain requirements regarding text amount, pictures and background images. Every requirement should be filled.

## Choices

I tried to keep it simple, while keeping in mind all the requirements of the project. In my opinion, I succeeded very well. The site looks clean, is easy to use and all the information can be gathered easily.
